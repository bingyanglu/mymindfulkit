I’ve never been good at memory games.

Not because I don’t try — I do. I’ve downloaded a bunch of apps over the years: those “brain training” ones with badges and progress charts and daily reminders that I always ended up ignoring. I wanted them to help me “focus better,” but mostly they just made me feel like I was failing at yet another thing.

Which is kind of the ADHD experience in a nutshell, right?

So when I started building an **N-Back game**, I didn’t plan for it to go anywhere. It was just a weekend thing. A "what if" project.  
What if I made one that didn’t feel like a punishment?  
What if it didn’t care whether I missed a day?  
What if it was small, quiet, and — dare I say it — fun?

And maybe also: what if I made it for me?

## What Even *Is* N-Back?

If you’re not familiar: N-Back is a kind of working memory training task. Basically, you’re shown a stream of things — letters, positions, sounds — and you have to say whether the current thing matches the one from N steps ago.

It’s been used in neuroscience research, and yes, there’s debate about how much it helps. But as someone with ADHD, here’s what I know: **doing it** feels like a workout for my attention.

Like, actual sweat-for-the-brain effort.  
But also... satisfying?

## Okay, But Why Build a Whole Version?

Because most versions I found online were — well — not kind.

They had:
- Harsh timers  
- Zero onboarding  
- Flashy ads  
- Loud failure noises (?? why)

And none of them felt like they were made for *someone like me*.

Someone who:
- Forgets instructions five seconds after reading them
- Feels nervous clicking “Start” in case they mess up
- Wants to try, but maybe also wants to close the tab and disappear

So I thought: what if it just… didn’t do any of that?

## What We Did Differently (or Tried To)

I say “we” because by now, I’ve dragged a few friends into this project. But honestly, it still feels like me, at 1 a.m., tweaking button sizes and wondering if I should use a gentler shade of blue.

Here’s what we changed:

- ✅ **Soft start.** No countdown anxiety. Just “you ready?”
- ✅ **No scores on screen.** Just one task at a time.
- ✅ **Feedback that doesn’t insult you.** “You showed up. That matters.”
- ✅ **No account required.** No leaderboard. No pressure.

It’s not perfect. There are bugs. Some days I forget to use it myself.  
But it exists. And that’s already more than I thought I could do.

## Who It’s For

It’s for the people who:
- Open ten tabs to start one task  
- Feel dumb because they forgot their friend’s name mid-convo  
- Want to train their brain, but not feel like it’s a test  

It’s for you, if your brain feels like a browser that never closes.  
And it’s for me — because building it was also how I reminded myself I could still finish something.

## Closing Thought

You don’t need to be good at it. You don’t need to do it every day.

But if, like me, you’ve been looking for a way to train your focus — not aggressively, not competitively, just **gently** — you’re welcome to try it.

No pressure. Just presence.
