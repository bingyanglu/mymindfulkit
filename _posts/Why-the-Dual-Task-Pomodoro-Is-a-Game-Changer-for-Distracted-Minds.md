Hi, I’m Evan Zhou. I have ADHD.  
My brain doesn’t go straight. It zigzags, detours, spirals, leaps. Sometimes it's brilliant. Most of the time, it’s exhausting.

So I built a Pomodoro timer. Not the normal kind.  
A weird one. A helpful one. For brains like mine.

## 🍅 What’s different about this timer?

Most Pomodoro tools expect one task, one focus block.  
But if you have ADHD, hyperfocusing on a single task for 25 minutes can be torture. Boredom kicks in. Distraction follows.

That’s why I built the **Dual-Task Pomodoro Mode**.  
You define **two tasks**, and the timer alternates between them each round (or every 2 rounds — you can customize this in settings).

✅ If you're overwhelmed, it gives you structure.  
✅ If you're bored, it gives you momentum.

## ⚙️ But it also supports regular Pomodoro

Not every day is chaos. Sometimes, single-task focus works.  
So yes, just flip the **“Dual Task Mode”** switch off in Settings.

You can also customize:

- Pomodoro duration (default: 25 minutes)  
- Short and long break durations  
- Number of rounds before long break  
- Sound & browser notification settings

## 🧠 Why it works better for ADHD

Because it respects how your brain works — not how productivity gurus think it *should* work.

- **Task switching becomes intentional**, not impulsive  
  → Avoid guilt spirals.

- **You stay stimulated**, not bored  
  → Prevent the “escape” to TikTok.

- **You feel progress**, not paralysis  
  → See each round and task add up.

## 🔀 Real-life task pairings that worked for me

- 📄 Writing + 📬 Email replies  
- 🧠 Idea planning + 🍃 Houseplants care  
- 💻 Coding + 📚 Reading notes  
- 🧾 Budget review + 🎨 Design tweaking

You don’t need to pair “big tasks”.  
Sometimes it’s just switching between “stuck and stuck” that keeps you moving.

## 🫂 You’re not lazy. Your brain just works differently.

I built this because I needed it.  
If it helps you too, that makes it even more worth it.
